# Sprite Rain Demo using PixiJS

Just a quick demo of a retro-styled rain effect using pixijs and a sprite animation created using image frames.

## Usage

Stick whatever image frames you want to use in ./assets numbered [1.png... n.png] and update the values in ./assets/anim.json to match what you want.

Note: Due to security settings in all modern browsers preventing local json loading, you will need to host this using a dev webserver on your localhost. (Python's `python3 -m http.server` is perfect for this)
